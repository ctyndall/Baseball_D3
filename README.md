# Baseball_D3

Practicing plotting with D3.

baseball_year.html plot location of each team for any given day, color codes their winning streaks (red for hot, blue for cold), and sizes for win percentage.

baseball_momentum.html compares win percentage for any given selection of games and compares for winners/losers of each rounds of the playoffs.
It seems that momemtum plays no significance in winning the world series or any given round.  Rather, just make it to the playoffs all and teams fair evenly.
